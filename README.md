After you install the application, you have to conduct the following steps to initialize
the installed application. You only need to do these once for all.

2. Create a new database and adjust the `components['db']` configuration in `common/config/main-local.php` accordingly.
3. Apply migrations with console command `yii migrate`. This will create tables needed for the application to work.
4. Set document roots of your Web server:

- for frontend `/path/to/rekrutmen/frontend/web/` 
- for backend `/path/to/rekrutmen/backend/web/` 

To login into the application, you need to first sign up, with any of your email address, username and password.
